                    <h3>June 20, 1791 </h3>
                    <h3>Royal Family Flees</h3>
                    <p>After the roayl family relocated to Paris from pressures of revolutionary forces, King Louis XVI and his family
                        attempted to flee Paris to see refuge and support from foreign powers. The royal family, disguised as servants,
                        departed from the Tuileries Palace under cover of the night. Their plan was to make their way to the eastern
                        frontier of France, hwere they hoped to find safety beyond the reach of the revolutionary forces. However,
                        their escape was married by series of missteps, setbacks, delays, missed connections, and suspicions along the way.
                        As they were on their way, a man spotted King Louis XVI because he was on the stamps. As news of the royal flight spread,
                        it ignited a wave of outrage and suspicion among the people because they interpreted the attempt as a betrayal of 
                        the nation and a threat to the revolution. It confirmed syspicions of many revolutionaries that the king was not committed to
                        the principles of the revolution and was seeking to undermine its progress with the help of foreign powers. It 
                        deepended the divide between the monarchy and the revolutionary forces.
