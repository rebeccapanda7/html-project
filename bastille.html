                    <h3>Storming of the Bastille</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>This was the first real act of the revolution.
                        Louis XVI was secretly assembling troops to crush the National Assembly. However, this plot
                        was discovered, and a rebel group call the San-Culottes stormed the Bastille. Fuled by economic hardships, political discontent, and rumors fo ryoalist conspiracy, 
                        members of the National Assembly as well as many other commoner citizens stormed the 
                        Bastille. The Bastille was a armory and a prison with prisoners who were against Louis XVI, and it symbolized the tyranny of the Bourbon monarchy. 
                        The guy in charge of the Bastille, Marquis de Launay, refused to surrender the prison which lead to fighting between 
                        the mob and the soldiers. He ordered the troops to open fire. However, the crowd managed to breach the outer defenses of the Bastille.
                        They freed all the prisoners and stole weapons and armor. They needed protection from 
                        the soldiers. They also took the warden hostage, who was then later killed in the aftermath.
                        The people cut off the heads of the soldiers and put them on pitchforks as a sign not to
                        mess with them as they walked through Paris. 
                        <br />
                        It marked the beginning of the French Revolution's more radical phase, characterized by the dismantling of the old order and the pursuit of republican ideals.
                        The fall of the Bastille was celebrated as a triumph of the people over depotism and became a potent symbol of popular resistance to royal authority.
                        This revolutionary act inspired widespread uprisings and the formation of local militias know as "National Guards". 
                        However it prompted King Louis XVI was afraid of the riots and political opposition which led him to make concessions to the revolutionary movement and to recognize the authority of the newly formed National Assembly.
